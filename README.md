# TI84Programs
All programs have only been tested on my TI-84 Plus CE, and so I do not know if they will work on other variants of the TI-84
To upload these to your calculator, you need to download Texas Instrument's TI Connect Software and use a USB-A to Micro USB-B cable (the cable that came with
your calculator and that you use to charge it) to upload the program
You can find instructions on how to upload programs to your calculator on google
