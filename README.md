# TI84Programs
All programs have only been tested on my TI-84 Plus CE, and so I do not know if they will work on other variants of the TI-84

To upload these to your calculator, you need to download Texas Instrument's TI Connect Software and use the cable that came with
your calculator and that you use to charge it to upload the program

You can also find instructions on how to upload programs to your calculator on google

The only way to view the code is through the TI Connect Software, you need to download the program from this Github repository
